- [x] Core dependencies installed (Zustand, UUID, date-fns, Lucide icons)

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- [ ] MVP Core Features (Weeks 1-2)
  - [ ] Basic consumption session logging
  - [ ] Local data storage with SQLite
  - [ ] Mobile-responsive UI
  - [ ] Privacy controls and data export

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Features

#### Phase 1: Core Logging (Priority 1)
- [ ] Comprehensive consumption form with all PRD fields
- [ ] Temporal information (date, time, duration)
- [ ] Location tracking with privacy controls
- [ ] Social context logging
- [ ] Device and accessory tracking
- [ ] Strain information with database integration
- [ ] Product modifiers (tobacco, kief, concentrate)
- [ ] Experience and effects rating

#### Phase 2: Data Management (Priority 2)
- [ ] Consumption history view
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Data export (JSON, CSV)
- [ ] Privacy controls and encryption
- [ ] Account deletion functionality

#### Phase 3: Analytics & Insights (Priority 3)
- [ ] Consumption pattern analysis
- [ ] Trend visualization
- [ ] Strain effectiveness tracking
- [ ] Social consumption patterns
- [ ] Monthly/weekly summaries

#### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Priority 4)
- [ ] Cloud sync with Supabase
- [ ] Multi-device synchronization
- [ ] Strain recommendation engine
- [ ] Advanced analytics with ML
- [ ] API for third-party integrations

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Complete consumption logging (< 2 minutes per session)
- [ ] Offline functionality for basic logging
- [ ] Data export in multiple formats
- [ ] Privacy-first data handling
- [ ] Mobile-optimized interface

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] App startup time < 3 seconds
- [ ] Responsive design for all screen sizes
- [ ] Local data encryption
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance
- [ ] Performance optimization

### User Experience
- [ ] Intuitive navigation and data entry
- [ ] Comprehensive yet not overwhelming
- [ ] Accessibility compliance
- [ ] Privacy controls clearly communicated

## Timeline & Milestones

### Week 1: Foundation
- [x] Project setup and architecture
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] Core component structure
- [ ] Basic UI layout

### Week 2: MVP Logging
- [ ] Complete consumption form
- [ ] Local data persistence
- [ ] Basic history view
- [ ] Mobile optimization

### Week 3: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Location services integration
- [ ] Advanced form fields
- [ ] Data filtering and search
- [ ] Privacy controls

### Week 4: Polish & Testing
- [ ] UI/UX refinement
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **SQLite Integration Complexity**: Start with simple localStorage, migrate to SQLite later
- **Location Services Battery Impact**: Make GPS optional with clear user controls
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimize with React.memo and efficient re-renders

### Privacy & Legal Risks
- **Data Sensitivity**: Implement local-first storage with optional cloud sync
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Include prominent disclaimers and data deletion options
- **User Trust**: Transparent privacy controls and clear data policies

### Scope Risks
- **Feature Creep**: Maintain focus on core logging functionality
- **Timeline Pressure**: Prioritize MVP features, defer advanced analytics
- **User Adoption**: Simple, intuitive design over complex features

## Future Scalability Considerations

### Architecture
- Modular component design for easy feature addition
- API-ready backend structure for cloud integration
- Extensible data models for future requirements

### Technology Choices
- Framework-agnostic design for potential migration
- Standard web technologies for broad compatibility
- Performance-optimized patterns from day one
