- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Enhanced Color Scheme**: Blue to red gradient for better visual distinction

**Key Improvements Over Original**:
- More granular intensity levels (10 vs 4)
- Quantity-based analysis in addition to session count
- Better visual hierarchy with enhanced tooltips
- Summary statistics dashboard
- Toggle between consumption metrics

### 2. Seasonal Analysis

**File**: `src/components/analytics/SeasonalAnalysis.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Seasonal Breakdown**: Analyzes consumption patterns across all four seasons

- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Sessions, quantities, popular strains, and preferred methods per season
- **Statistical Insights**: Calculates seasonal variation and consistency
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded trend indicators and seasonal icons

**Seasonal Data**:
- **Winter** (Dec-Feb): Snowflake icon, blue theme
- **Spring** (Mar-May): Leaf icon, green theme  
- **Summer** (Jun-Aug): Sun icon, yellow theme
- **Fall** (Sep-Nov): Leaf icon, orange theme

**Metrics Per Season**:
- Total sessions and quantity consumed
- Average quantity per session
- Sessions per week
- Most popular strain and consumption method
- Trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)

### 3. Holiday Impact Analysis

**File**: `src/components/analytics/HolidayImpactAnalysis.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Major Holiday Coverage**: 8 key holidays with customizable date ranges
- **Impact Assessment**: High/medium/low impact classification
- **Comparative Analysis**: Holiday consumption vs. normal day patterns
- **Percentage Calculations**: Shows how much holidays affect consumption
- **Trend Identification**: Above/below normal consumption patterns

**Supported Holidays**:
- New Year's (Dec 31 - Jan 2)
- Valentine's Day (Feb 14)
- St. Patrick's Day (Mar 17)
- 4th of July (Jul 4)
- Halloween (Oct 31)
- Thanksgiving (Nov 25-28)
- Christmas (Dec 24-26)
- New Year's Eve (Dec 31)

**Impact Metrics**:
- Session count comparison vs. normal days
- Quantity consumed during holiday periods
- Percentage change from baseline
- Impact level classification
- Trend direction indicators

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `@radix-ui/react-tabs`: For tabbed interface components
- Enhanced UI components: `tabs.tsx`, `card.tsx`

### Integration Points
- **Main Component**: `src/components/CannabisTracker.tsx`
- **Analytics Section**: Enhanced with 7 tabs including the new features
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 3x3 grid layout for mobile devices

### Data Processing
- **AnalyticsService**: Enhanced with `normalizeQuantity` method
- **Real-time Calculations**: All metrics computed using React `useMemo`
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Supports both legacy and new quantity formats

## üì± User Experience

### Desktop Interface
- Horizontal tab navigation with icons
- Full-width analytics content
- Hover effects and smooth transitions

### Mobile Interface
- 3x3 grid layout for easy navigation
- Compact tab design with smaller icons
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatible
- Keyboard navigation support
- High contrast color schemes
- Semantic HTML structure

## üéØ Usage Instructions

### Accessing Enhanced Analytics
1. Navigate to the **Analytics** section in the main navigation
2. Use the tab navigation to switch between different analytics views
3. Each new component provides detailed insights and interactive elements

### Switching Between Views
- **Overview**: Core dashboard with key metrics
- **Frequency**: Time-based consumption patterns
- **Locations**: Geographic consumption analysis
- **Strains**: Strain-specific analytics
- **Intensity**: Enhanced consumption heatmap
- **Seasonal**: Seasonal pattern analysis
- **Holiday**: Holiday impact assessment

### Interacting with Components
- **Heatmap**: Hover over cells for detailed information
- **Seasonal**: Click through season cards for detailed metrics
- **Holiday**: Review impact levels and trend indicators

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Custom Holiday Creation**: User-defined special dates
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date range selection and custom periods
- **Export Capabilities**: PDF reports and data exports
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered consumption forecasting
- **Integration**: Calendar apps and health tracking

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading for large datasets
- **Caching**: Smart caching for frequently accessed data
- **Offline Support**: Basic analytics when offline
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure `@radix-ui/react-tabs` is installed
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Check for proper type definitions
3. **Performance Issues**: Large datasets may require optimization
4. **Mobile Layout**: Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

### Development Notes
- Components use React 19+ features
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
- Lucide React for icons

## üìä Data Requirements

### Minimum Data for Analysis
- **Seasonal**: At least 3 months of data across different seasons
- **Holiday**: Sessions around major holiday dates
- **Intensity**: Daily consumption patterns over several weeks

### Data Quality
- Consistent date formatting (ISO format)
- Accurate quantity measurements
- Complete strain and vessel information
- Valid location data
